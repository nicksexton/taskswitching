C implementation of PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing)

implemented as a library of C functions (eg., see pdp_objects.h and
pdp_objects.c) intended to be general to PDP models. This project is
intended to form a general basis for implementing any PDP style
connectionist model, running a trial or block of trials, creating a
population of models, plus miscellaneous functions for creating
stimuli, analysing data etc.
